# Graphs

Basic Swift Graph structures with no library dependencies

## Purpose of this library

- Cross-platform Swift friendly
- Focus on graphs and algorithms needed in gaming. Elminate the need for any 2D GameplayKit algorithms
- Focus on test coverage and readability over accomplishing the best performance for some functions. Performance can improve in time as test benchmarks are added and recorded, but thorough test cases should help make that migration easier without regressions.
